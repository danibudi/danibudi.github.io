<h1>8.4  REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS AND SPECIFICATION SIZE</h1>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Tools for requirements
management store and manage information about requirements. They
allow testers to prioritize requirements and to follow their
implementation status.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">In a narrow sense, they are
not testing tools, but they are very useful for defining a test based
on requirements (see section 3.7.1) and for planning the test; for
example, the test could be oriented on the implementation status of a
requirement. For this purpose, <u>requirements management tools</u>
are usually able to <b>exchange information</b> with <b>test
management tools.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Thus, it is possible to
<u>seamlessly interconnect requirements, tests, and test results.</u>
For every requirement the corresponding tests can be found and vice
versa. The tools also help to find inconsistencies or holes in the
requirements, and they can identify requirements without test cases;
that is, requirements that otherwise might go untested.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Requirements and
specification documents generally combine text, graphs, and special
mathematical diagrams and symbols. The nature of the presentation
depends on the particular style, method, or notation used. When
measuring code or design size, you can identify atomic entities to
count (lines, statements, bytes, classes, and methods, for example).</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">However, a requirements or
specification document can consist of a mixture of text and diagrams.
For example, a use case analysis may consist of a UML use case
diagram along with a set of use case scenarios that may be expressed
as either text or as UML activity diagrams. Because a requirements
analysis often consists of a mix of document types, it is difficult
to generate a single size measure.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">EXAMPLE 8.10</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">There are obvious atomic
elements in a variety of requirements and specification model types
that can be counted:</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">i. <b>Use case diagrams</b>:
Number of use cases, actors, and relationships of various types</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">ii. <b>Use case</b>: Number
of scenarios, size of scenarios in terms of steps, or activity
diagram model elements</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">iii. <b>Domain model
(expressed as a UML class diagram)</b>: Number of classes, abstract
classes, interfaces, roles, operations, and attributes</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">iv. <b>UML OCL
specifications</b>: Number of OCL expressions, OCL clauses</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">v. <b>Alloy models</b>:
Number of alloy statements—signatures, facts, predicates,
functions, and assertions (Jackson 2002)</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">vi. <b>Data-flow diagrams
used in structured analysis and design</b>: Processes (bubbles
nodes), external entities (box nodes), data-stores (line nodes) and
data-flows (arcs)</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">vii. <b>Algebraic
specifications</b>: Sorts, functions, operations, and axioms</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">viii. <b>Z specifications</b>:
The various lines appearing in the specification, which form part of
either a type declaration or a (non-conjunctive) predicate (Spivey
1993)</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">We can enforce
comparability artificially by defining a <b>page as an atomic entity</b>,
so that both <i>text and diagrams</i> are composed of a number of
sequential pages. Thus, the <b>number of pages</b> <i>measures length</i>
for arbitrary types <i>of documentation</i> and is frequently used in
industry.</font></p>

<p><font color="#800000"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">EXAMPLE
1</font></font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Suppose P is a program
produced to meet the following specification, S:</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">The inputs to the program
are exam scores expressed as percentages. The outputs are comments,
generated according to the following rules:</font></p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">For scores under 45,
	the program outputs “fail”</font></p>
	<li/>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">For scores between
	45 and 80 inclusive, the program outputs “pass”</font></p>
	<li/>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">For scores above 80,
	the program outputs “pass with distinction”</font></p>
	<li/>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Any input other than
	a numeric value between 0 and 100 should produce the error message
	“invalid input”</font></p>
</ul>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><u>A set of five test cases
for P is</u></font></p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">(40, “fail”)</font></p>
	<li/>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">(60, “pass”)</font></p>
	<li/>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">(90, “pass with
	distinction”)</font></p>
	<li/>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">(110, “invalid
	input”)</font></p>
	<li/>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">(fifty, “invalid
	input”)</font></p>
</ul>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Suppose that on input “40,”
program P outputs “fail.” Then we say that P is correct on that
input. If, for the input “110,” the program P outputs “pass
with distinction,” then P fails on this input; the correct output
should have been the error message “invalid input.”</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><i>The objective of a
software testing strategy is to devise and run a set of test cases
that satisfy or cover a set of test requirements.</i> The <b>test
requirements</b> are defined in<b> terms of a software artifact or
model of a software artifact, where an artifact may be the
</b><b><span style="background: #ffff00">requirements, specification,
design, program code</span></b><b>, etc</b>. These models are often
graphs, for example, flowgraphs.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">One testing strategy is to
select test cases so that <i>every program statement is executed at
least once</i>. This approach is called <b>statement &shy;coverage</b>—each
statement is a test requirement. For deterministic software, each
test case causes one test path through the program to execute. In
terms of the program <b>flowgraph</b>, <span style="background: #ffff00">statement
coverage is achieved by finding a set of test cases that execute test
paths such that every flowgraph node lies on at least one test path</span>.</font></p>
<p><font color="#800000"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">EXAMPLE
2</font></font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Drawing 1 contains a
program written to meet the specification S of Example 1. We can
achieve 100% statement coverage for this program by choosing just two
of the test cases: one with input “90,” and one with input “40.”
</font>
</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">For “90,” the
	program executes the path &lt;ABDEFG&gt;.</font></p>
	<li/>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">For “40,” the
	program executes the path &lt;ABCEG&gt;. </font>
	</p>
</ul>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Thus, C is covered in the
second case, and all the other nodes are covered in the first case,
so we have a complete statement coverage.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Another testing strategy is
to select test cases so that every program branch is executed at
least once. This approach, called branch (or edge) coverage, means
finding test cases that cause the execution of a set of test paths
such that every edge lies on at least one test path.</font></p>
<p><font color="#800000"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">EXAMPLE
3</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#800000"><img src="SW_metrics_Chapter3_Software%20Requirements%20Metrics_html_6723e268db906afc.gif" name="Frame1" alt="Frame1" align="bottom"/>
</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">The set of test cases
selected in Example 2 satisfies branch as well as statement coverage.
However, this will not always be true. In the same program, the two
paths ABCEFG and ABDEFG satisfy 100% statement coverage, but fail to
cover the edge EG.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">The most exhaustive
structural testing strategy is to select test cases such that every
possible test path is executed at least once. This approach is called
complete path coverage. In terms of the program flowgraph, complete
path coverage requires running every single test path through the
flowgraph. This strategy, although appealing in theory, is normally
impossible in practice. If the program has even a single loop, then
complete path coverage can never be achieved because a loop gives
rise to an infinite number of test paths.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">There is another
fundamental impediment to any structural testing strategy:<span style="background: #ffff00">
</span><b><span style="background: #ffff00">infeasible paths</span></b>.
<span style="background: #ffff00">An infeasible path is a program
path that cannot be executed for any input</span>. In practice,
infeasible paths can appear even in the simplest of programs.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">EXAMPLE 9.20</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">In the program of Drawing
2, the path ABCEFG is infeasible. To see why, notice that node C is
executed only when the score is less than 45, while node F is
executed only when the score is more than 80. Thus, no input score
can cause the program to execute both nodes C and F. The existence of
infeasible paths can mean that, in practice, we may not be able to
achieve 100% coverage for any structural testing strategy (even
statement coverage).</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Numerous other structural
testing strategies have been proposed. In particular, researchers
have tried to define strategies so that </font>
</p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">1. They are more
comprehensive than statement and branch coverage (in the sense of
requiring more test cases).</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">2. The number of test cases
required is finite even when there are loops.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Several of these strategies
make use of the notion of <span style="background: #ffff00">simple
paths</span> and prime paths. They define a <span style="background: #ffff00">simple
path</span> as a <u>path that does not contain the same node more
than once except for the first and last node</u>. A <span style="background: #ffff00">prime
path</span> is a <span style="font-style: normal"><u>s</u></span><u>imple
path that “does not appear as a proper subpath of any other simple
path</u>.”</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>Examples</b>:</font></p>
<p>• <font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><font color="#800000">Edge-pair
coverage</font>: Testing “each reachable path of length up to 2”
in the flowgraph.</font></p>
<p>• <font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><font color="#800000">Simple-round-trip
coverage</font>: Testing “at least one round-trip path for each
reachable node in” the flowgraph “that begins and ends a
round-trip path,” where a round-trip path is a prime path that
starts and ends at the same node. This requires every cycle through a
loop to be tested, but does require branch coverage or all cycles
through loops that contain decisions.</font></p>
<p>• <font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><font color="#800000">Prime
path coverage</font>: Testing all prime paths in the flowgraph. This
requires testing all cycles that start at reachable nodes, and,
depending on the branches inside a loop, requires testing execution
paths that cause a loop to cycle two or more times. Prime path
coverage satisfies branch coverage, and requires a finite number of
tests.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">We have already noted one
problem with structural testing strategies (namely, <i>infeasible
paths</i>). In practice, there are two further important obstacles:</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">1. No structural strategy
on its own (even 100% complete path coverage when feasible) can
guarantee adequate software testing. Consider, for example, the
program in Illustration 1, which implements the specification in
Example 1. The path ABDEFG correctly outputs “distinction” when
the input is “90.” However, the correct output for one execution
does not mean that every execution of the path ABDEFG is correct. For
instance, the input score “110” also executes the path ABDEFG,
but the program wrongly outputs “pass with distinction” when it
should be producing “invalid input.”</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">2. Knowing the set of paths
that satisfies a particular strategy does not tell you how to create
test cases to match the paths. This problem is undecidable in
general—no automated method is guaranteed to either find the
appropriate test cases or determine that such data does not exist;
however, some commercial testing tools provide assistance.</font></p>

Test Effectiveness Ratio</b></font></font></font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">For a given program and a
set of cases to test it, we would like to know the extent to which
the test cases satisfy a particular testing strategy.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">EXAMPLE 2.1</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Suppose we are testing the
program in Illustration 1, and we have run two test cases with input
scores “60” and “90.” The test cases traverse two paths,
ABDEG and ABDEFG, covering 6 of the 7 statements, 7 of the 9 edges,
and 2 of the 4 paths in the program. Thus, we say that statement
coverage is 86%, branch coverage is 78%, and path coverage is 50%.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">We can define these
percentages formally. Let C be a <b>testing criterion</b> that
requires us to cover a class of test requirements (such as paths,
simple paths, linearly independent paths, LCSAJs, edges, or
statements). For a given program and set of test cases, the <b>test
effectiveness ratio</b> (TER<sub>C </sub>) is defined as</font></p>
<p><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">	<b>TER</b><sub><b>C</b></sub><b>
= (Number of C requirements executed at least once) / (Total number

change request is declarative, i.e. it states what needs to be
accomplished, but leaves out how the change should be carried out.
Important elements of a change request are an ID, the customer (ID),
the deadline (if applicable), an indication whether the change is
required or optional, the change type (often chosen from a
domain-specific ontology) and a change abstract, which is a piece of
narrative. An example of a change request can be found in

<p><em>“<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">The
most widely adopted tools for requirements continue to be general
document software such as Microsoft Office or Google Docs (40% to 50%

often lead to poorly managed requirements, thus eliminating and
exceeding any cost benefit the tools themselves have. Requirements
end up captured in a variety of documents and spreadsheets
supplemented by post-it notes in unmanaged versions with no
traceability or reuse. This creates a more costly user acceptance
testing cycle, both in the time to execute as well as remediation of
issues found late in the process, where they are far more costly to
address.”</font></font></em></p>

<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Software
and hardware teams have to work together, in tight collaboration,
which is difficult when they use different tools, use different
terminology, and work in different cadences with difference
methodologies. &nbsp;All details such as marketing requirements,
functional requirements, test cases and other items that define the
scope of what you’re building are related in some fashion, either
directly or indirectly. Best practices for requirements traceability
in complex products requires methods and tools that connect
requirements to the upstream and downstream artifacts and testing,
with verifiable coverage to prove compliance with internal controls
and external regulations.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Your
organization can adopt these four best practices around modern
requirements management and requirements traceability to ensure
product quality, decrease time-to-market and achieve regulatory
compliance.</font></font></p>
<h3 class="western"><strong><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Four
Best Practices for Requirements Traceability</font></font></strong></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>1.
Connect stakeholders and contributors to the requirements they care
about to ensure the right people can weigh in on important decisions
at the right time.</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Traceable
relationships are as much about connecting the people as they are
about connecting the requirements themselves. Each requirement in the
system has members of the team associated with it—analysts,
architects, development, verification and quality assurance among
them—and stakeholders and customers who care about its status. With
connected relationships built into your project you can quickly get
interested parties involved in decision-making on short notice.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>2.
Automate bi-directional requirements traceability to minimize risk
and ensure quality.</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Manually
updating an old-style traceability matrix is not only cumbersome and
time consuming, it leaves open the risk for human error. In the
development of safety-critical products like medical devices and
airplanes, this risk isn’t acceptable. And it’s difficult to
prove to an auditor that you got it right.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Key
to managing requirements traceability is the ability to view source
requirements and their related items downstream to lower-level
requirements and then back to the source, and know the status of
those items at each step of the product development process. And
because this data may be stored in multiple systems, it’s key to be
able to connect tools via open APIs and automatically pull data into
a single actionable system with visualized coverage of these trace
relationships.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>3.
Connect data, conversations and decisions in a single system in the
product development process</b><span style="font-weight: normal">.</span></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Being
able to visualize coverage of trace relationships is imperative. But
what happens when you find a gap, or a test is failing? The ability
to confer and collaborate with the people connected to the
requirement right in the system allows you to capture decisions and
actions and keep that information associated with the requirement.
Down the road, if you need to revisit decisions, all data is stored
and easy to find.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">With
this managers can, for example, verify that their requirements are
connected to downstream test cases and see what percentage of those
tests have passed. In a system of action, every test case has a
comment and activity stream accessible to all users. Testers and
contributors can capture decisions, answer questions and resolve
issues transparently and responsively.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>4.
Conduct formal reviews in compliance with internal controls or
industry regulations with built-in reporting.</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">In
the case of proving compliance with a set of rules and regulations
you need to show your requirements, their traceable connections to
test plans, and verification that all test have passed. Using a
requirements management tool that has built-in formal reviews and
reporting for auditors makes this process less cumbersome and more
reliable.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><font color="#800000"><b>Summary</b></font>
</font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">The
main goal of the requirements phase is to produce the software
requirements specification (SRS), which accurately captures the
client's requirements and which forms the basis of software
development and validation. </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">The
basic reason for the difficulty in specifying software requirements
comes from the fact that there are three interested parties—the
client, the end users, and the software developer. The requirements
document has to be such that the client and users can understand it
easily and the developers can use it as a basis for software
development. Due to the diverse parties involved in software
requirements specification, a communication gap exists. This makes
the task of requirements specification difficult. There are three
basic activities in the requirements phase. The first is problem or
requirement analysis. The goal of this activity is to understand such
different aspects as the requirements of the problem, its context,
and how it fits within the client's organization. The second activity
is requirements specification, during which the understood problem is
specified or written, producing the SRS. And the third activity is
requirements validation, which is done to ensure that the
requirements specified in the SRS are indeed what is desired. </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">There
are <u>three main approaches to analysis;</u> <b>unstructured</b>
approaches rely on interaction between the analyst, customer, and
user to reveal all the requirements (which are then documented). The
<i>second</i> is the <b>mod</b><b>eling-</b><b>oriented</b> approach,
in which a model of the problem is built based on the available
information. The model is useful in determining if the understanding
is correct and in ensuring that all the requirements have been
determined. </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><font color="#800000">Modeling</font>
may be <font color="#800000">function-oriented</font> or
<font color="#800000">object-oriented</font>. The <i>third</i>
approach is the <b>prototyping approach</b> in which a prototype is
built to <i>validate the correctness and completeness of
requirements</i>. To satisfy its goals, an SRS should possess
characteristics like completeness, consistency, unambiguous,
verifiable, modifiable, etc. A good SRS should specify all the
functions the software needs to support, performance of the system,
the design constraints that exist, and all the external interfaces. </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">One
<u>method</u> for <i>specifying the functional specifications</i>
that has become popular is the <font color="#800000"><b>use case
approach</b></font>. With this approach the functionality of the
system is specified through use cases, with each use case specifying
the behavior of the system when a user interacts with it for
achieving some goal. Each<font color="#800000"> use case</font>
contains a <font color="#800000">normal scenario</font>, as well as
many <font color="#800000">exceptional scenarios</font>, thereby
providing the complete behavior of the system. Though use cases are
meant for specification, as they are natural and story-like, by
expressing them at different levels of abstraction they can also be
used for problem analysis. </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">For
<b>va</b><b>li</b><b>dation</b>, the most commonly used method is
reviewing or inspecting the requirements. In requirements
inspections, the team of reviewers also includes a representative of
the client to ensure that all requirements are captured. </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">The
main metric of interest for requirements is some quantification of
system size, as it can be used to estimate the effort requirement of
the project. <font color="#800000">The most commonly used size metric
for requirements is the function points</font>. The function point
metric attempts to quantify the functionality of the system in terms
of five parameters and their complexity levels which can be
determined from the requirements of the system. Based on the count of
these five parameters for different complexity levels, and the value
of fourteen different environmental factors, the function point count
for a system is obtained. <font color="#800000">The function point
metric can be used for estimating the cost of the system</font>. </font></font>
