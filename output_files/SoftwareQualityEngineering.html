     <h2>1.1 Software Engineering Culture and Ethics</h2>
     <p>
The culture of an organization is a critical success factor in its process improvement ef-
forts. "Culture" includes a set of shared values and principles that guide the behaviors, activities,
priorities, and decisions of a group of people working in the same area. When coworkers align
along common beliefs, it is easier to induce changes that will increase the group's effectiveness
and its probability of survival. A  shared  culture  is  one  difference  between  a  "team"  and  a  "bunch
of bozos on a bus.</p>
</section>
<section>  
<h3>Customer involvement is the most critical factor in software quality.</h3>
<p>Any successful enterprise requires that you both do the right thing, and do the thing right. We ex-
pect that professional software developers know how to do the "thing" right. Doing the right
thing, though, requires an unambiguous understanding of what your customer expects. To this
end, we strive to maximize participation of our customers in our development activities.
</p>
</section>
<section>  
<h3>Sharing the vision of the final product with the customer</h3>
<p>
The classic failure of software development is that the product delivered only vaguely matches the
expectations  of  the  customer. Every  project,  even  small  ones  developing  internally reusable  software  components,  goes  through  a  formal,  written  requirements  specification  process
If you don't have time to do it right, when will you have time to do it over?</p>
</section>
<section>  
<h6>Quality is the top priority; long-term productivity is a natural consequence of high quality</h6>
<h6> Ongoing education is every team member's responsibility.</h6>
<h6> Have a peer, rather than a customer, find a defect.</h6>
<h6> Written software development procedures can help improve quality.</h6>
<h6> Continual improvement of your software development process is both possible and essential.</h6>
<h6>Never let your boss or your customer talk you into doing a bad job.</h6>
<h6>People need to feel that the work they do is noticed.</h6>
</section>
<section>  
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>You can't buy a culture in shrink-wrap; you must roll your own. Every software
team works in a different context of expectations, pressures, application domains, and technolo-
gies. The process of agreeing upon principles and values provides many opportunities for im-
proving both the work environment and the work results. A shared culture is essential to progress
through the software process maturity sequence to the discipline of repeatable and measurable
software development processes.</p>

<h3>Value and Cost of Quality (COQ)</h3>
<p >Associated with providing poor quality products or services. Categories: </p>
<ul >
      <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left"><h6 >internal failure costs</h6> associated with defects found before the customer receives the product or service</li>
      <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left"><h6 >external failure costs</h6> associated with defects found after the customer receives the product or service</li>
      <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left"><h6 >appraisal costs </h6>incurred to determine the degree of conformance to quality requirements </li>
      <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left"><h6 >prevention costs</h6> incurred to keep failure and appraisal costs to a minimum.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h6 >Cost of quality</h6><p> is a methodology that allows an organization  to determine the extent to which its resources are used for activities that  prevent poor quality, that appraise the quality of the organization's 
products  or services, and that result from internal and external failures. Having such  information allows an organization to determine the potential savings to be  gained by implementing process improvements. </p>
</section>
<section><p>Quality-related activities that incur costs may be divided  into:
<ul >
      <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left"><h6 >prevention costs</h6> </li>
      <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left"><h6 >appraisal costs</h6> </li>
      <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left"><h6 >internal costs</h6> </li>
      <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left"><h6 >external costs</h6> </li>
</section>
<section>
<h4 >Prevention costs</h4>
<p >Incurred to prevent or avoid quality  problems. Associated with the design, implementation, 
and  maintenance of the quality management system. Planned and incurred  before actual operation, and they could include:</p>
<ul >
      <li class="fragment" ><h6 >Product or service requirements</h6> establishment of specifications for incoming materials, processes, finished products, and services</li>
      <li class="fragment" ><h6 >Quality planning</h6>creation of plans for quality, reliability, operations, production, and inspection</li>
      <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left; "><h6 >Quality assurance</h6>  creation and maintenance of the quality system</li>
      <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left; "><h6 >Training</h6> development, preparation, and maintenance of programs</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>  
<h4 >Appraisal costs</h4>
<p >Associated with measuring and monitoring activities related to quality. These costs are associated with the suppliers' and customers' evaluation of purchased materials, processes, products, and services to ensure that they conform to specifications. They could include:</p>
<ul >
      <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left"><h6>Verification</h6>checking of incoming material, process setup, and products against agreed specifications</li>
      <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left"><h6>Quality audits</h6>confirmation that the quality system is functioning correctly</li>
      <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left"> <h6>Supplier rating</h6>assessment and approval of suppliers of products and services</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Internal failure costs</h4>
<p>Incurred to remedy defects discovered before the product or service is delivered to the customer. These costs occur when the results of work fail to reach design quality standards and are detected before they are transferred to the customer. They could include:</p>
<ul>
      <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left"><h6 >Waste</h6>performance of unnecessary work or holding of stock as a result of errors, poor organization, or communication</h6></li>
      <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left"><h6 >Rework</h6></li>
      <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left"><h6 >Failure analysis</h6></li>
</ul> 
</section>
<section>
<h4>External failure costs</h4>
<p>Incurred to remedy defects discovered by customers. These costs occur when products or services that fail to reach design quality standards are not detected until after transfer to the customer. They could include:</p>
<ul>
      <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left"><h6 >Repairs and servicing</h6></li>
      <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left"><h6 >Warranty claims</h6></li>
      <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left"><h6 >Complaints</h6>all work and costs associated with handling and servicing customers' complaints </li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Cost of quality and organizational objectives</h4>
<p>The costs of doing a quality job, conducting quality improvements, and achieving goals must be carefully managed so that the long-term effect of quality on the organization is a desirable one. 
The quality cost system, once established, should become dynamic and have a positive impact on the achievement of the organization's mission, goals, and objectives.</p>

      <h4>Software Quality Improvement</h4>
      <p>Software underpins nearly every business process. Therefore it's essential to lower the cost of testing and improve the quality of your software. These four pointers will help you improve software quality and improve testing efficiency.</p>
</section>
<section><h6> Test at the right time</h6>
<p>By testing earlier you will be able to detect and solve defects rather than having to resolve them at the end of the process. The later software bugs are detected, the longer and more expensive they are to resolve.
Fixing bugs early can be a game-changer. The firm cut development time by 25 percent and bug fixing costs by 31 percent.
Get testers involved during the requirements and design stage so they can help formulate a more effective test framework. More than 70 percent of software issues in a live environment can be traced back to poor requirements.
Implement Static testing early in the life cycle to give immediate reactions on quality issues regarding your software development.
</p></section>
<section><h6>Improve testing organisation</h6>
<p>Be professional in your testing or risk harming your business.
Implement specific policies to direct a consistent approach like using repeatable industry standard testing processes and training testers within this framework.
Remember: Use metrics. This helps keep track of where you are ensuring that you don't start before you're ready, and you finish when you're done to prevent wasted bandwidth.
</p></section>
<section><h6>Innovation leads to improvement<h6>
<p>Write automated tests wherever possible to make your testing process more efficient. Make sure that your testing is targeted too. By using test design techniques and risk-based testing you can make sure that you will be using fewer, but more worthwhile tests.
</p></section>
<section><h6>Keep reviewing</h6><p>
You can have too much of a good thing. Just because certain methods have worked in the past doesn't mean they always will. Processes of evaluation and refactoring allow your testing team to maximise efficiency by reviewing what worked well.
Implement a Root cause analysis process which distinguishes whether issues were a 'testing miss', a 'development miss' or a 'requirements or design miss'. This will help to identify areas for improvement throughout the whole software development process.</h6>

     <h2>Software system safety</h2>
     <p align="left">
     In software engineering, software system safety optimizes system safety in the design, development, use, and maintenance of software systems and their integration with safety-critical hardware systems in an operational environment.
      There are three major types of software failure. Not all of these can be rectified by the programmers. The three types are:</p>
<ul>
   <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left; "><h6 >Software logic errors,</h6> </li>
   <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left; "><h6 >Software support errors,</h6> </li>
   <li class="fragment" style="text-align:left; "><h6 >Hardware failures </h6> </li>
