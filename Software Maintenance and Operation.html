<p><strong>Important to</strong>: Everyone, especially the
	CEO, CIO and CTO.</p>
	<li/>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>:&nbsp;<br/>
How long does it
	take a new average feature, idea, fix or any other kind of change to
	get into a paying customer's hands, in production, from the moment
	of inception in someone's mind. MTTC is what it takes you from the
	moment you see an opportunity until you can actually utilize it. The
	faster MTTC is, the faster you can react to market changes.</p>
	<li/>
<p><strong>How to measure:</strong><br/>
&nbsp;We start
	counting from moment of the change's inception in someone's head
	(Imagine a marketing person coming up with a competing idea to that
	of a competitor's product, or a bug being reported by a customer)</p>
	<li/>
<p>One way to capture and measure mean time to change is by
	doing a value streaming exercise, as we will touch on in a later
	chapter in this book.</p>
	<li/>
<p><strong>Expected Outcome:</strong> &nbsp;MTTC should become
	shorter and shorter as Dev maturity grows.&nbsp;</p>
	<li/>
<p><strong>Common Misunderstandings:&nbsp;</strong><br/>
MTTC
	is not the same as the often cited &quot;<strong>Change lead time</strong>&quot;
	as proposed in multiple online publications.</p>
	<li/>
<p>Change Lead time only counts the time from the start of
	development of a feature, when real coding begins.</p>
	<li/>
<p>MTTC will measure everything that leads up to the coding as
	well, which might include design reviews, change committees,
	budgeting meetings, resource scheduling and everything that stands
	in the way of an idea as it makes its way into the development team,
	all the way through to production and the customer.</p>
	<li/>
<p>From a CEO, CIO and CTO view , MTTC is one of the most
	important key metrics to capture. Unfortunately, many organizations
	today do not measure this.</p>

<p>System Availability</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Total Hours of Downtime</p>
</ul>
<p>With regard to in-process data, generally those at the back end
(e.g., testing defects) are more reliable than those at the front end
(e.g., design reviews and inspections). To improve data reliability,
it is important to establish definitions and examples (e.g., what
constitutes a defect during design reviews). Furthermore, validation
must be an integral part of the data collection system and should be
performed concurrently with software development and data collection.</p>
<p><font color="#800000"><b>Reliability, Availability, and Defect
Rate</b></font></p>
<p>Reliability and availability certainly support each other. Without
a reliable product, high availability cannot be achieved. <font color="#800000">The
operational definition of reliability is mean time to failure (MTTF)</font>.
For the exponential distribution, the failure rate (or better called
the instantaneous failure rate) (l) is constant and MTTF is an
inverse of it. As an example, suppose a company manufactures
resistors that are known to have an exponential failure rate of 0.15%
per 1,000 hours. The MTTF for these resistors is thus the inverse of
.15%/1000 hours (or 0.0000015), which is 666,667 hours.</p>
<p>The F in MTTF for reliability evaluation refers to all failures.
For availability measurement of computer systems, the more severe
forms of failure (i.e., the crashes and hangs that cause outages) are
the events of interest. Mean time to system outage, a reliability
concept and similar to MTTF calculation-wise, is a common
availability measurement. As an example, if a set of systems has an
average of 1.6 outages per system per year, the mean time to outage
will be the inverse of 1.6 system-year, which is 0.625 years.</p>
<p>As discussed earlier, in addition to the frequency of outages, the
duration of outage is a key element of measuring availability. This
element is related to the mean time to repair (MTTR) or mean time to
recovery (average downtime) measurement. To complete the example in
the last paragraph, suppose the average downtime per outage for a set
of customers was 1.5 hours, the average downtime per system per year
was 2.3 hours, and the total scheduled uptime for the systems was
445,870 hours, the system availability would be 99.98%.</p>
<p>Because of the element of outage duration, the concept of
availability is different from reliability in several aspects. First,
availability is more customer-oriented. With the same frequencies of
failures or outages, the longer the system is down, the more pain the
customer will experience. Second, to reduce outage duration, other
factors such as diagnostic and debugging tools, service and fix
responsiveness, and system backup/recovery strategies play important
roles. Third, high reliability and excellent intrinsic product
quality are necessary for high availability, but may not be
sufficient. To achieve high availability and to neutralize the impact
of outages often requires broader strategies such as clustering
solutions and predictive warning services. Indeed, to achieve high
availability at the 99.99% (52.6 minutes of downtime per year) or
99.999% level (5.2 minutes of downtime per year), it would be
impossible without clustering or heavy redundancy and support by a
premium service agreement. Predictive warning service is a
comprehensive set of services that locally and electronically monitor
an array of system events. It is designed to notify the customer and
the vendor (service provider) of possible system failures before they
occur. In recent years several vendors began offering this kind of
premium service as a result of the paramount importance of system
availability to critical business operations.</p>
<p>Over the years, many technologies in hardware and software have
been and are being developed and implemented to improve product
reliability and system availability. Some of these technologies are:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p>Redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID)</p>
	<li/>
<p>Mirroring</p>
	<li/>
<p>Battery backup</p>
	<li/>
<p>Redundant write cache</p>
	<li/>
<p>Continuously powered main storage</p>
	<li/>
<p>Concurrent maintenance</p>
	<li/>
<p>Concurrent release upgrade</p>
	<li/>
<p>Concurrent apply of fix package</p>
	<li/>
<p>Save/restore parallelism</p>
	<li/>
<p>Reboot/IPL (initial program load) speed</p>
	<li/>
<p>Independent auxiliary storage pools (I-ASP)</p>
	<li/>
<p>Logical partitioning</p>
	<li/>
<p>Clustering Remote cluster nodes</p>
	<li/>
<p>Remote maintenance</p>
</ul>
<p>Where data breakout is available, of the outages affecting system
availability, software normally accounts for a larger proportion than
hardware. As the Business Week report (1999) indicates, a number of
infamous Web site and server outages were due to software problems.
Software development is also labor intensive and there is no commonly
recognized software reliability standard in the industry.</p>
<p>Both reliability (MTTF) and defect rate are measures of intrinsic
product quality. But they are not related in terms of operational
definitions; that is, MTTF and defects per KLOC or function point are
not mathematically related.</p>
<p>In the software engineering literature, the two subjects are
decoupled. The only relationship between defect levels and ranges of
MTTF values reported in the literature (that we are aware of) are by
Jones (1991) based on his empirical study several decades ago. Table
13.3 shows the corresponding values for the two parameters.</p>
<p>Jones's data was gathered from various testing phases, from unit
test to system test runs, of a systems software project. Size of the
project is a keyvariable because it could provide crude links between
defects per KLOC and total number of defects, and therefore possibly
to the volume of defects and frequency of failures. But this
information was not reported. However, this relationship is very
useful because it is based on empirical data on systems software.
This area clearly needs more research with a large amount of
empirical studies.

<p>The same Business Week report (&quot;Software Hell,&quot; 1999)
indicates that according to the U.S. Defense Department and the
Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University,
there are typically 5 to 15 flaws per KLOC in typical commercial
software. About a decade ago, based on a sample study of U.S. and
Japanese software projects by noted software developers in both
countries, Cusumano (1991) estimated that the failure rate per KLOC
during the first 12 months after delivery was 4.44 in the United
States and 1.96 in Japan. Cusumano's sample included projects in the
areas of data processing, scientific, systems software,
telecommunications, and embedded/real time systems. Based on
extensive project assessments and benchmark studies, Jones (2001)
estimates the typical defect rate of software organizations at SEI
CMM level 1 to be 7.38 defects per KLOC (0.92 defects per function
point), and those at SEI CMM level 3 to be 1.30 defects per KLOC
(0.16 defects per function point). For the defect rates per function
point for all CMM levels, see Jones (2000) or Chapter 6 in which we
discuss Jones's findings. Per IBM customers in Canada, this writer
was told that the average defect rate of software in Canada a few
years ago, based on a survey, was 3.7 defects per KLOC. Without
detailed operational definitions, it is difficult to draw meaningful
conclusions on the level of defect rate or failure rate in the
software industry with a certain degree of confidence. The
combination of these estimates and Jones's relation between defect
level and reliability, however, explains why there are so many
infamous software crashes in the news. Even though we take these
estimates as &quot;order of magnitude&quot; estimates and allow large
error margins, it is crystal clear that the level of quality for
typical software is far from adequate to meet the availability
requirements of businesses and safety-critical operations. Of course,
this view is shared by many and has been expressed in various
publications and media (e.g., &quot;State of Software Quality,&quot;
Information Week, 2001).</p>
<p>Based on our experience and assessment of available industry data,
for system platforms to have high availability (99.9+%), the defect
rate for large operating systems has to be at or below 0.01 defect
per KLOC per year in the field. In other words, the defect rate has
to be at or beyond the 5.5 sigma level. For new function development,
the defect rate has to be substantially below 1 defect per thousand
new and changed source instructions (KCSI). This last statistic seems
to correlate with Jones's finding (last row in Table 13.3). To
achieve good product quality and high system availability, it is
highly recommended that in-process reliability or outage metrics be
used, and internal targets be set and achieved during the development
of software.</p>
<p>Before the product is shipped, its field quality performance
(defect rate or frequency of failures) should be estimated based on
the in-process metrics. 
</p>
<p>In addition to reducing the defect rate, any improvements that can
lead to a reduction in the duration of downtime (or MTTR) contribute
to availability. In software, such improvements include, but are not
limited to, the following features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Product configuration</li>
<li>Ease of install and uninstall</li>
<li>Performance, especially the speed of IPL (initial program load) or reboot</li>
<li>Error logs</li>
<li>Internal trace features</li>
<li>Clear and unique messages</li>
<li>Other problem determination capabilities of the software</li>
</ul>
